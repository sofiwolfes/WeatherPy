# WeatherPy
Challenge 6

For this challenge, you will use the weather description data you've already retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. 

Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. 

Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
